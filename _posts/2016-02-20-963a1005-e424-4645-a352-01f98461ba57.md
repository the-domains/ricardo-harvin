A Dream Within a Dream 

Take this kiss upon the brow! 

And, in parting from you now, 

Thus much let me avow ---
You are not wrong, who deem

That my days have been a dream;

Yet if hope has flown away

In a night, or in a day,

In a vision, or in none,

Is it therefore the less gone?

_All_ that we see or seem

Is but a dream within a dream.

I stand amid the roar

Of a surf-tormented shore,

And I hold within my hand

Grains of the golden sand ---

How few! yet how they creep

Through my fingers to the deep,

While I weep --- while I weep!

O God! Can I not grasp
Them with a tighter clasp?

O God! can I not save

One from the pitiless wave?

Is _all_ that we see or seem

But a dream within a dream?

**Edgar Allan Poe
